  good quotes: 
    - "I have worked on all kinds of projects during the apprenticeship. Some of the more notable ones I have done are contact mining for customer information, running our customer experience reports and finding solutions to improve that score, Creating quotes for customers request on our line of products, Troubleshooting customers problems and helping them find a solution, and creating updated instructions for some of our internal processes in the company."
    - "A typical week in the apprenticeship starts on Monday with work from 8-5 and then after work I usually take the rest of the day to complete one of the classes I have taken. I usually repeat this process for the rest of the week. My situation is a little different since I rarely use my work time for school, but I look at it as an opportunity to put in time learning the companies processes and products while I'm in school that way when I graduate I am up to speed, and there is nothing holding me back from performing on that next level."
    - "Working at Leybold has helped me develop a number of skills. The ones that I would say have improved the most since starting the apprenticeship though would be my problem solving skills and my communication skills. This is because in a business to be successful these are two of the most important skills to have  have the ability to solve issues on the fly makes you adaptable to any situation and it shows that you are actively always looking for a solution or a better way to do something. While having communication skills lets you network and get to know others you speak with. This makes for a stronger well bonded team that in most cases are very efficient because they are on the same page."
    - "My favorite class so far would have been principals of business. This was a class a enjoyed a lot and found that the things I learned in that class are things that we are all in contact with on a daily basis, and the higher you go in an organization the more those principals are going to impact/effect your career."
    - "My favorite part would just be the experience. In this program I have found that the comradery and the experience you gain is priceless. This being said those two aspects make the experience I've had a very good one. It has also given me the ability to find a company that I am happy with and that they are happy with the work I do."
    - "In 5 years I see my self moving up the chain. I plan on going as far as I can both in my career and investing in the knowledge of the my company and there products, but in the short term of 5 years I see myself working as an account manager in outside sales."
    - "I would just like to say thank you to everyone at GACC. This experience has been life changing; I think the ability to get work experience and go to school while you actively work with a company on your career is game changing especially when it comes to todays job market. You have not only set the people in this program up for success, but you have laid the path for many others to reach it as well. This program is a good test of character and work ethic on the apprentices part because of the work and school schedule and the business background they receive. It allows us to develop as people but also as workers in a professional setting, and it puts us years ahead of others that are only coming out of college because of the experience."

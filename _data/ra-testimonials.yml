  occupation: "Sales Engineer"
  company: "Stellar Precision Components & KASTO INC"
  projects: "I have worked on etching labels onto metal parts, reorganization of equipment, installation of a 3D printer, entering data into a database, shipping and manufacturing. The list is endless and I am so grateful to have experienced such a variety of positions and tasks during my time."
  skillDev: "I have developed a tremendous amount of soft skills such as communication and collaboration. I have also gained a lot of hard skills and knowledge on the machinery and basic operations of a manufacturing facility. I learned about the strenuous process to create a singular component and how mass production works. I was able to see how precise these parts must be in order to function properly. I also viewed firsthand how to problem solve on the fly when a machine is not functioning properly."
  enviro: "My favorite part of the Pre-Apprenticeship was the people. I have met so many amazing and talented individuals who have taught me so much about the workforce and life in general. At Stellar I was surrounded by so many people and each week I worked with someone new and was able to learn about not only that position, but about them and their path to where they are now."

  quote: "With the apprenticeship program offered by the GACC I am able to still work full time and earn a degree in mechatronics simultaneously. It's the best of both worlds.Mechatronics is an amazing and diverse field with limitless opportunities if you are willing to take on the tasks. I think it would be difficult to find another career as rewarding as this for someone technically minded and with a drive to succeed. This program has elevated my life in so many ways both personally and professionally. I cannot say enough about this experience and the amazing team that holds it all together."

    "I have worked on all kinds of projects during the apprenticeship. Some of the more notable ones I have done are contact mining for customer information, running our customer experience reports and finding solutions to improve that score, Creating quotes for customers request on our line of products, Troubleshooting customers problems and helping them find a solution, and creating updated instructions for some of our internal processes in the company. Working at Leybold has helped me develop a number of skills. The ones that I would say have improved the most since starting the apprenticeship though would be my problem solving skills and my communication skills. This is because in a business to be successful these are two of the most important skills to have  have the ability to solve issues on the fly makes you adaptable to any situation and it shows that you are actively always looking for a solution or a better way to do something. While having communication skills lets you network and get to know others you speak with. This makes for a stronger well bonded team that in most cases are very efficient because they are on the same page. I would just like to say thank you to everyone at GACC. This experience has been life changing; I think the ability to get work experience and go to school while you actively work with a company on your career is game changing especially when it comes to todays job market. You have not only set the people in this program up for success, but you have laid the path for many others to reach it as well. This program is a good test of character and work ethic on the apprentices part because of the work and school schedule and the business background they receive. It allows us to develop as people but also as workers in a professional setting, and it puts us years ahead of others that are only coming out of college because of the experience."

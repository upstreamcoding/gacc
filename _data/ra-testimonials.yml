  quote: "With the apprenticeship program offered by the GACC I am able to still work full time and earn a degree in mechatronics simultaneously. It's the best of both worlds.Mechatronics is an amazing and diverse field with limitless opportunities if you are willing to take on the tasks. I think it would be difficult to find another career as rewarding as this for someone technically minded and with a drive to succeed. This program has elevated my life in so many ways both personally and professionally. I cannot say enough about this experience and the amazing team that holds it all together."

  quote: "My favorite part would just be the experience. In this program I have found that the comradery and the experience you gain is priceless. This being said those two aspects make the experience I've had a very good one. It has also given me the ability to find a company that I am happy with and that they are happy with the work I do. In 5 years I see myself moving up the chain. I plan on going as far as I can both in my career and investing in the knowledge of the my company and their products, but in the short term of 5 years I see myself working as an account manager in outside sales."

  quote: "Things like the program don't happen everyday and the fact that there are chances like this that can help people explore a lifelong career that will be around for the foreseeable future are what makes it special. I especially enjoyed the robotics class, because more and more places are switching to automation using robotics so it's definitely one of the classes that will help out the most going forward in our careers."

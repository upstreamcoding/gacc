  quote: "My favorite part of the Pre-Apprenticeship was the people. I have met so many amazing and talented individuals who have taught me so much about the workforce and life in general. At Stellar I was surrounded by so many people and each week I worked with someone new and was able to learn about not only that position, but about them and their path to where they are now. Moreover, I have developed a tremendous amount of soft skills such as communication and collaboration. I have also gained a lot of hard skills and knowledge on the machinery and basic operations of a manufacturing facility."

  quote: "Thanks to the Pre-Apprenticeship Program my people skills and understanding of the world have improved. I interacted with and learned from very different people who I hadnâ€™t really been with before. I would watch and observe the workday of the employees at the companies and help them when I could. It was cool to see the day-to-day operations at the companies. The impact of the program is inevitable as I will be able to apply this experience to future jobs and I feel like I am more prepared for anything that comes my way."

  company: "Accutrex"
  quote: "I assisted the person that I am shadowing with whatever he needs help with on the project at hand. A very specific project was helping with automating machining of specific parts. During the program I have learned to plan out designs better and take more in-depth notes on dimensions and measurements. It helped a lot meeting the people in the workplace and being around and starting to understand so much cool equipment. I will become a full apprentice with this company and I will continue my education here in Pittsburgh because of the quality of the program."

It was a great experience being able to interact with my classmates in a real-world work environment and going to the actual internship instead of school. The program showed me what a real career could possibly look like, and what I may want to do with my future."

  projects: "I have worked on etching labels onto metal parts, reorganization of equipment, installation of a 3D printer, entering data into a database, shipping and manufacturing. The list is endless and I am so grateful to have experienced such a variety of positions and tasks during my time."
  skillDev: "I have developed a tremendous amount of soft skills such as communication and collaboration. I have also gained a lot of hard skills and knowledge on the machinery and basic operations of a manufacturing facility. I learned about the strenuous process to create a singular component and how mass production works. I was able to see how precise these parts must be in order to function properly. I also viewed firsthand how to problem solve on the fly when a machine is not functioning properly."
  enviro: "My favorite part of the Pre-Apprenticeship was the people. I have met so many amazing and talented individuals who have taught me so much about the workforce and life in general. At Stellar I was surrounded by so many people and each week I worked with someone new and was able to learn about not only that position, but about them and their path to where they are now."

Getting over this feeling was very challenging."
  future: "It confirmed my desire to continue studying in this field."

          During the Apprenticeship Program you will rotate through the different departments of your company beginning from Sales, Marketing and Finance to Inventory, Warehouse and Production side. The goal is it to get a profound understanding of all parts of the company and to understand core and supporting processes. This way you as Sales Engineer have the right skill set to successfully pitch a sale to a customer and to consult them with product variations and use cases for your product. In some cases the Sales Engineer is the link between the customer and the company's R&D department. With your insight to the customer's needs and demands you can be an active part in product development and adjustment processes.

           Next to working full-time at one of the participating companies the apprentices will have classroom training at CCAC to obtain the Sales Engineer certificate as well as an associate’s degree. The curriculum at CCAC includes business administration classes, but also production management and fundamental skills in manufacturing (MT1 certification). Apprentices will be paid while working and getting trained on the job as well as attending their college classes. Moreover, the companies pay the student’s college tuition, which makes our program an attractive alternative to pay for college education while simultaneously gaining significant work experiences.

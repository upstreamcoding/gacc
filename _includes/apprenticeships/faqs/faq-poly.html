            GACC works closely with the community colleges, career and technical centers and other credentialing institutions in the areas closest to where our apprentices live or work. The education partner awards academic credit for completion of instructions that may be delivered in a classroom on a community college campus or online either synchronously or asynchronously.

            <p>The Related Technical Instruction may be delivered in a classroom format or online over a robust enterprise platform that enables 24/7 access to training content and tracks skill gain against competency models.  The curriculum includes classes in basic electrical and their components, motor control, wiring, power distribution, hydraulics, pneumatics and robotics.
              For example, in Mechatronics Industrial Processes, apprentices learn how engineering materials are gathered and processed for use. The course covers principles of production planning, inventory management and the operating and troubleshooting of industrial equipment. Students who successfully pass the course will sit for the Manufacturing Skill Standards Council's (MSSC) Processes and Production and Maintenance Awareness exams towards achievement of the Certified Production Technician (CPT) credential. </p>

Our members understand and agree with the objectives of the German American Chamber of Commerce, Inc. (GACC), which in general are to promote, develop and expand bilateral trade, investment and economic relations between the United States of America and the Federal Republic of Germany.

The members of the GACC grant permission to the GACC to publish their membership data in the membership directory and other publications, including on the internet.

The membership begins on the day the signed application form as well as payment of the membership fee (initial membership fee) are received (start date).
The membership will run for the remainder of the calendar year (initial term).

The first month of the membership will count as a full month if the start date is before the 15th day of the month. The initial term cannot be less than four (4) calendar months. If a member wishes to join after September 15th, the initial term includes the remainder of that calendar year as well as the 12 months of the year immediately following (extended initial term).

Our Members understand and agree that the membership will automatically renew for a period of one year (consecutive term) at the end of the initial term/extended initial term or each consecutive term (renewal date) unless notice of non-renewal is provided (via mail or via email to lbruemmer@gaccpit.com) at least four weeks prior to the end of the calendar year.

The annual membership fee is due upon the start date and afterwards on each renewal date. Should the start date be after January 1st, the annual fee is to be paid on a pro-rated basis for the remaining full months of the year while still corresponding to the membership terms (the first month of the membership will count as a full month if the start date is before the 15th day of the month). Should a member join on or after September 15th, the initial membership fee will include the pro-rated annual membership fee for the remaining full months of that year as well as the annual membership fee for the upcoming year (extended initial membership fee).

Pro-rating does not affect the start date of the membership and the immediate access to the Membership benefits. In the event of payment by credit card, our members and authorized users of the respective credit card agree that the membership will be automatically charged to the same credit card that was used for the initial membership fee or the most recent renewal (unless the member has notified and authorized to use another card). Therefore, our members agree to allow the encrypted electronic handling and storing of the credit card information for the described future use.

Our members acknowledge that, when participating in any GACC event or program, they enter an area where photography, audio and video recording may occur. As participants of such GACC events or programs, our members grant to GACC, its representatives, employees and contractors, the right to take photographs of and/or to audio or video record the members and their property in connection with the event. They authorize GACC, its assigns and transferees to copyright, use and publish the same in print and/or electronically.

They also waive the right to inspect or approve any photo, audio or video recording taken by GACC or the person or entity designated to do so by GACC. The members expressly acknowledge and agree that GACC may use such photographs and/or audio and/or videos with or without their names for any lawful purpose, including but not limited to purposes such as publicity, illustration, advertising, and Web content, including but not limited to social media outlets and GACC’s websites. They expressly release GACC’s officers, and employees, and each and all persons involved, from any liability connected with the recording, digitizing, or publication and use of photographs, computer images, video and/or sound recordings.

By submitting the membership application form one acknowledges the GACC’s membership privacy policy and is duly authorized to provide all personalized third party data entered in this application form.

### Online Platform Terms & Conditions

Upstream Coding Service provides an online and offline platform and resources to give users (collectively **"Members"**) a corpus of currated technical instruction and explaination on the topics of web development and design, coding or programming, and business and entrepreneurship and in various formats for free or for a fee, and in Upstream Coding's sole discretion, (collectively, **"Service"**). 

The **"Portal"** means the website located at [upstreamcoding.com](https://upstreamcoding.com/) and any associated software, applications, and Internet services under Upstream Coding's control, whether partial or otherwise, used in connection with providing the Service provided by Upstream Coding. Access to the Service through the Portal by Members is collectively the **"Membership"**. An active **Membership** means a timely payment for the **Service** has been received and the **Service** is available via the **Portal**. An active **Membership** is your acceptance of all parts of this Terms of Service.

Together with our independent practitioners, technical contractors, thought leaders, interns and those generically described as Teaching Assistants, "TAs" (collectively **"Instructors"**). The Upstream Coding Service will also permit the community of users of the Upstream Coding Service to engage in discussions and communications with one another and with the Instructors. **"Starter"**, **"Premium"** and **"Pro"** are levels of member permission to access Services.

**Cancellation and No Show Policies.** We determine the rescheduling and cancellation policies and apply them at our discretion. You should contact us directly, not Instructors, for any rescheduling or cancellation questions. The Upstream Coding Cancellation Policy is incorporated into these Terms.

**Cancellation of Membership or a Service.**

When you sign up for a Service or a Membership, or Member Content that requires a payment, you agree to pay it.

You may cancel your membership at any time and such cancellation will be effective at the end of the month in which you provide notice of cancellation. If your reoccurring billing date for the month has passed, and you give your notice of cancellation, you will not be refunded that month's payment. To cancel your membership please log in to your account on the website and follow the instructions for cancellation. Your membership will automatically renew each month on or about the same date as your initial payment, until you notify us of your decision to cancel your membership. Upstream Coding reserves the right to cancel your subscription at any time.

If you cancel your Membership during your enrollment in a Service that is delivered over multiple weeks for which your Membership provided you the benefit of a discounted fee to obtain a seat to receive that Service (and that another Member could have similarly benefited) you will be immediately billed for the balance of the undiscounted retail price of that Service as posted on the Upstream Portal.

We use third-party service providers, which offer various payment methods. Such payment methods could change.

**You Agree To Pay Us For Your Purchases.**

You agree to pay for all Services that you purchase through the Portal, and you agree that we may charge your selected payment method, either directly or through the services of a third-party payment processor, for any such payments. Only those payment methods accepted by our third-party payment processor can be used to purchase products, goods, or services through the Upstream Coding Service.

You are responsible for all fees charged to make payments using payment processors through the Upstream Coding Service.

**Pre-Authorization.** When you provide a credit card number to us to activate and/or pay for any fees related to Upstream Coding, we, through our third-party payment processor, may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to a purchase to verify the credit card is valid and/or has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase. These pre-authorizations will reduce your available balance by the authorization amount until it is released or reconciled with the actual charge. Please contact your card issuer if you have additional questions regarding when an authorization amount will be removed from your statement.

**Timing of Charges.** Charges occur within a reasonable time of the transaction or shortly thereafter, and multiple charges during the same period may be aggregated together.

**Recurring Payment Program.** Upstream offers a recurring payment program, which allows you to pay the balance owed for courses in installments. You can elect to enroll in this program by completing and submitting the Recurring Payment Authorization Form. If you have submitted this Form you have authorized us to charge your checking/savings account or credit card for the amount and at the intervals set forth in the Form. You can cancel your enrollment in our recurring payment program by notifying us in writing at least 15 days prior to the next billing date of your intent to cancel the authorization. To cancel, please notify us in writing at [hello@upstreamcoding.com](mailto:hello@upstreamcoding.com). You are responsible for all recurring charges made prior to the effective date of cancellation.

You may send us an email to dispute charges to your account within 30 days of the charge.

**Disputed Charges.** You agree to submit any disputes regarding any charge to your account in writing to Upstream Coding within thirty (30) days of such charge, or your dispute is waived and such charge will be final and not subject to challenge. You may dispute a charge by sending an email to us at [hello@upstreamcoding.com](mailto:hello@upstreamcoding.com).

**Refunds.** Upstream Coding does not provide refunds generally, refunds for past payments or refunds for pending charges made according to these Terms.  We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to refund fees paid to us.  A cancellation of a Membership will be effective at the end of the month in which we receive notice of cancellation; there will be no pro-rata refunds. Upstream Coding may modify its refund policy at any time with or without specific notice to you; provided, however, that the refund policy in effect at the time of any transaction shall apply to such purchase despite any subsequent change in such policy. Please contact [hello@upstreamcoding.com](mailto:hello@upstreamcoding.com) to request a refund.

**Coding Series Deposit Refunds.** A partial deposit refund will be issued, less any credit card processing fees, only if during the interview, at the sole discretion of Upstream Coding, it is determined you will be unable to successfully complete the workshop.

**Taxes.** **"Taxes"** include sales, use, value added, or transaction taxes and other government-imposed fees and charges. You are responsible for determining and paying the appropriate taxes resulting from a transaction occurring through the Upstream Coding Service. Upstream Coding is not responsible for collecting, reporting, paying, or remitting to you any such taxes, unless required by law.

**Currency.** We accept U.S. Dollars.

**Links To Other Web Sites.** Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by Upstream Coding. Upstream Coding has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree Upstream Coding shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such web sites or services.

**Facilitator of Information.** Members and workshop participants understand Upstream Coding is a facilitator of information and does not guarantee that your abilities will improve. No employment or other opportunities are represented or warranted, either with Upstream Coding or anyone else.

**Attendance.** Attendance is voluntary. Missing more than one session can result in you being asked to stop attending. No refund will be issued, but you will have the opportunity to attend a future series at no additional cost.

**Memberships:** You may cancel your membership at anytime prior to your account billing date.

**Coding Series Deposit Refunds.** A partial deposit refund will be issued, less any credit card processing fees, only if during the interview, at the sole discretion of Upstream Coding, it is determined you will be unable to successfully complete the workshop.

**Coding Series Changes.** Titles and content are subject to change to keep series curriculum inline with best practices, employment trends and ensure training remains relevant.

**Termination.**

We may terminate or suspend Membership and access to Service and the Portal immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.

All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.

**Changes.** We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. You agree to visit this page periodically to review the most current Terms of Service. If you object to any changes to these Terms, your only recourse will be to stop using the Service.

**Consent.** By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.

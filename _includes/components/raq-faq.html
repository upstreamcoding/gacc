          Since our Apprenticeship program is highly company-oriented, it is our goal to fully understand your business and the required skill set for your workforce. With that in mind we can adjust the program’s curriculum to guarantee a workforce tailored to your company needs with apprentices that will have a leg up on their competition, since they receive hands-on experience while simultaneously learning theory.

              With our broad network and contacts to the PA State Department of Labor and Industry and other county workforce development boards we are always looking for additional funding to minimize the investment on the company side. Those grants can help pay the apprentices tuition fees and their wages.

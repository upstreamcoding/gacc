**What information we collect and how we use it**
The data you enter into the form is collected to register you as a member, to communicate with you, to invite you to our events and to send you our newsletter / our member magazine.

Furthermore, your data will be published in the member directory and other publications, amongst others on the internet, to facilitate an exchange between our members.

Your data will be processed outside of the EU, namely the US and may be accessible to other members outside of the EU and the US.

The provisioning of your data is carried out by means of an online web application. Confidentiality, integrity (inviolability), authenticity (genuineness) and availability of personal data can therefore not
be guaranteed.

**Legal Basis**
The collection, storage and usage of your data is based on its necessity for the fulfillment of the membership service contract, Article 6 (1) b) GDPR, or, where necessary, on your explicit consent Article 6 (1) a) GDPR

**Disclosures of your information**
Your personal data is transmitted to the following external service providers for the purpose of membership database management: wildapricot membership management software, Constant Contact email marketing software. These providers are compliant with the GDPR. Their respective privacy statements can be read here and here. We may release your information to regulatory or law enforcement authorities, if we are required to do so.

**Storage period**
Your data is stored after collection for the duration of your membership. Statutory data and document retention periods may require your data to be stored beyond the duration of your membership.

**Objecting to data processing**
You can object to the processing of your data and request a full deletion at any time by contacting
us via e-mail. Please note that we will not be able to provide any further membership services to
you without your data.

**Your rights as a data subject**
You have the following rights according to the EU General Data Protection Regulation: If your
personal data is processed, you have to right to obtain information regarding the storage of your
personal data (Article 15 GDPR). If incorrect personal data is processed, you have the right to
correction of such (Article 16 GDPR). If legal requirements are given, you have the right to request
the deletion or limitation of processing, and you have the right to object to such processing
(Articles 17, 18 and 21 GDPR). In the event of an objection, we will no longer be able to reach you
as our member, and membership with our organization will be terminated. Since data processing is
based on a contract, and since data processing is carried out via automated processes, you have a
right to data portability where applicable (Article 20 GDPR). Should you exercise your abovementioned rights, the GACC will review whether statutory requirements are met.
Please contact GACC – New York to exercise your rights: dataprivacy@gaccny.com.

**Changes to our Privacy Policy**
The privacy policy may be changed by the GACC at any time. If we change our privacy policy in the future, we will disclose those changes here and, if practicable, via email.

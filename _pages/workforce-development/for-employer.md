## Company-first Approach

GACC Registered Apprenticeships and Pre-Apprenticeships are employer-driven frameworks that drive industry-recongized skills and competencies while giving space for customized training that meets employer talent demand.  Employers benefit from a more engaged, eager-to-learn worker that can concurrently learn through on-the-job training, earn money and acquire job ready skills.

With that in mind we can adjust the programâ€™s curriculum to guarantee a workforce tailored to your company needs with apprentices that will have a leg up on their competition, since they receive hands-on experience while simultaneously learning theory.

## Build a High-Yield Talent Pipeline

GACC Registered Apprenticeships and Pre-Apprenticeships are employer-driven, rigorous skills development frameworks that drive employee development of industry-recongized skills, occupation-specific competencies and talent sets that employers hold in high value and in-demand.

• Help employers create a sustainable pipeline of skilled talent
• Attract more young people to manufacturing careers
• Invest in training to build employee loyalty

Employers benefit by hiring employees predisposed to progressive skill gains and on-the-job learning. The worker naturally feels valued by the employer and that a career pathway likely exists for them at the company.

 German American Apprenticeship: Employer-sponsored training and education
• Employer selects and hires the apprentice; this is the primary relationship
• Employer provides on the job training (OJT). Active training and not job shadowing is an important aspect.
• Employer invests in the apprentice:
• Hourly wages while at work,
• Tuition for RTI (Related Technical Instruction),
• Full-time hours combining OJT and Classroom Training (Dual Program)

GACC tailors the related instruction to meet the employer's needs delivering a positive workplace dynamic and more.

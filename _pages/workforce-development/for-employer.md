## Build a High-Yield Talent Pipeline

GACC Registered Apprenticeships and Pre-Apprenticeships are employer-driven frameworks that drive employee development of industry-recongized skills, competencies and talent sets that employers value.

Employers benefit by hiring enployees predisposed to progressive skill gains and on-the-job learning. The worker naturally feels valued by the employer and that a career pathway likely exists for them at the company.

GACC tailors the related instruction to meet the employer's needs delivering a positive workplace dynamic and more.

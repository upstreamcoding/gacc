                <p>The manufacturing industry in particular is currently facing challenges such as:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>the loss of skilled workers due to retirements (baby boomer generation)</li>
                    <li>structural problems in the education system (student debt, low attractiveness of careers in manufacturing)</li>
                      <li>a high degree of flexibility in the US labor market. This contributes to the fact that the duration of employment of trained specialists in companies is much shorter compared to Germany: employees in the USA are much quicker prepared to change jobs.</li>
                  </ul>

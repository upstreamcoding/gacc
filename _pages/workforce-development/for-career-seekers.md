GACC Apprenticeships are a proven career pathway that yield technical know-how that will help prepare one for career success. On-the-job training, instruction-based learning, and earning nationally-recognized industry credentials with employer-support create a scaffolding for a person's career success.

At the end of the program, GACC apprentices are likely to be more experienced and employable than other students their age, but also have a guaranteed employment in their desired field of employment without the tremendous debt that comes with a college degree.

The goal of the Dual Apprenticeship program is for the apprentice to have a defined set of skills that are acknowledged in the industry but also to be employable by the company.

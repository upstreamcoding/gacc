Thanks to the dual vocational education and training system, companies in
Germany can qualify skilled worker exactly as their requirements. Abroad, the
model of dual vocational education and training is often uncommon. This poses
considerable challenges for companies, including German firms, in finding wellqualified skilled workers as needed. Made or planned direct investments of German
companies abroad are at risk. For this reason, The German Chambers of Commerce,
Delegations and Representations of German Industry and Commerce (AHKs),
the German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (IHKs) and the Association of
German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHK e.V.) support companies in
training skilled workers abroad based on the German model.

            <p>The manufacturing industry in particular is currently facing challenges such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the loss of skilled workers due to retirements (baby boomer generation)</li>
                <li>structural problems in the education system (student debt, low attractiveness of careers in manufacturing)</li>
                  <li>a high degree of flexibility in the US labor market. This contributes to the fact that the duration of employment of trained specialists in companies is much shorter compared to Germany: employees in the USA are much quicker prepared to change jobs.</li>

<p>Our Pre-Apprenticeship programs is geared towards seniors in High School and engages them with a paid internship and additional technical classroom education as a dual enrollment class. It ideally leads into in one of our four Apprenticeship programs after graduation.</p>

<p>The Apprenticeship program gives high school graduates, but also employees already working in a company, the opportunity to benefit from the German-based dual vocational training concept, which merges classroom training at a local community with hands-on work experiences at a company.</p>

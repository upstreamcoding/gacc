Thanks to the dual vocational education and training system, companies in
Germany can qualify skilled worker exactly as their requirements. Abroad, the
model of dual vocational education and training is often uncommon. This poses
considerable challenges for companies, including German firms, in finding well-qualified skilled workers as needed.
            </p>

            <p>
              Made or planned direct investments of German
              companies abroad are at risk. For this reason, The German Chambers of Commerce,
              Delegations and Representations of German Industry and Commerce (AHKs),
              the German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (IHKs) and the Association of
              German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHK e.V.) support companies in
              training skilled workers abroad based on the German model.

              Hiring a new employee can be an arduous and challenging process. Hiring the wrong employee is a costly mistake. The most reliable and cost-effective way to bring new skills in-house -- and retain great talent -- is to upskill existing employees.
            </p>

            <p>
              Upstream will develop an employee upskilling program specific to a company's tech stack or client service.
            </p>

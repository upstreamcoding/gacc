## Competitive Advantage for Young Workers
Our program allows the apprentice to learn the theoretical skills from our Pennsylvania-certified instructors, community colleges and universities, and apply these skills immediately at the company without getting into tremendous financial debts.

We are working closely with local community colleges (CCAC) and other educational partners (Manufacturing Assistance Center University of Pittsburgh, Bidwell Academy) to provide the best education possible at the lowest cost possible to ease expenses for the companies.

At the end of the program, not only will our apprentices be more experienced and employable than other students their age, but also have a guaranteed employment in their desired field of employment without the tremendous debt that comes with a college degree.

The goal of the Dual Apprenticeship program is for the apprentice to have a defined set of skills that are acknowledged in the industry but also to be employable by the company.

## PA REGISTERED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS

-  Registered apprenticeship programs are structured, occupational training programs that
combine on-the-job training with related technical instruction that increases an apprentice’s skill
level and wages. They are approved and registered by the Pennsylvania Apprenticeship and
Training Council (Council) that can be used to train current employees or new hires. After the
program is completed, the apprentice becomes a journeyperson and is issued a certificate of
completion of apprenticeship which is a nationally recognized credential.

-   There are four different models of programs. Group, Non-Joint and Joint as well as Individual,
Non-Joint and Joint. Group means that there is more than one employer included in the
program. Individual is just a one-on-one relationship with the employer and apprentice. Joint
means that there is union representation for the employer.

-  Every program has a sponsor. The sponsor is responsible for the overall operation of the
program working in collaboration with partners. A sponsor can be any person, association,
committee or organization. A group model type of sponsor can reduce the burden on
employers.

- Programs must be a minimum of 2,000 hours which is one year of on-the-job training identified
as a work process. Every 2,000 hours of on-the-job training is supplemented by a minimum of
144 hours of related technical instruction that should complement the training. Most programs
last about four years, but can range from one to six. Apprenticeships can be designed to be
time-based, competency-based or a hybrid of both.

- Employers identify the skills and knowledge that will be learned and provide the on-the-job
training. Employers can also provide the related technical instruction in house or by a thirdparty training provider such as a career technical center or community college. Related
instruction can be based at a school, provided at the job site or completed on line. Both on-thejob training and related instruction need to include instruction on safe and healthy work
practices.

- Apprentices start working from day one with incremental wage increases as they become more
proficient on the job. Apprenticeships can be found in all industries, from traditional sectors like
construction and manufacturing to emerging sectors like energy, information technology and
health care. Currently, PA works with a list of over 1,374 apprenticeable occupations that have
been acknowledged by the federal government. The Council also approves occupations that
are not included on the federal list.

- Program sponsors will develop a set of standards that will need presented to and approved by
the Council. Standards are a written plan designed to move an apprentice from a low or no skill
entry-level position to full occupational proficiency. Standards must meet parameters
established under the National Apprenticeship Act and the PA Apprenticeship and Training Act
that are designed to protect the welfare of the apprentice.

- Two important sections of the standards include a well-developed work process and a related
technical instruction outline. These highlight the tasks and courses that will be followed by each
apprentice to completion. They are captured by hours or competencies.

- It is possible for a sponsor to grant credit to a new apprentice for work experience and
education. The employer decides how much credit will be given towards the program. Up to 80
percent of the on the job hours and up to 100 percent of the instruction hours may be credited.

- Apprentices are mentored by experienced workers which have been identified by the employer.
Programs that do not have union involvement can mentor from a 1:4 ratio which means 1
apprentice to 1 - 4 mentors. That increases in increments of 5 as more apprentices are brought
into the program. The next range would be 2 apprentices to 5 - 9 mentors and then 3
apprentices to 10 – 14 mentors. Union programs follow a mentor/supervision ratio that is
agreed to in their collective bargaining agreements.

- Apprentices receive increases in pay as their skills and knowledge increase. Individual
employers decide what wage their apprentice will begin and end at with increases throughout
the apprenticeship as skill benchmarks are attained.

- Registered apprenticeship programs can align with pre-apprenticeship programs to provide the
fundamental skills needed to enter and succeed in a program and to create a pipeline for
recruiting.

- Local workforce boards and Pennsylvania CareerLink® Offices can develop career pathway
strategies, recruit and screen candidates, provide supportive services and contribute funding for
the on-the-job training or related instruction.

- The Apprenticeship and Training Office will provide technical assistance to develop standards
and register a program. The office can be reached at apprenticeship@pa.gov.

Pre-Apprenticeship services and programs are designed to prepare students to enter and succeed in registered Apprenticeship programs. The program gives High School students the opportunity to get hands-on experience at a company (getting paid minimum $10/h), while getting classroom training and practice labs to receive an industry recognized certificate (e.g. from the MS Institute). After graduation the students can accelerate into one of our four Apprenticeship Programs in exciting career paths. 

Through dual enrollment agreements, students will be trained skills that are relevant for the On-the-Job training at the company in classroom and lab training. Upon successful completion of that they will receive an nationwide industry recognized certificate (e.g. Manufacturing Technician Level 1 from the MSI Institute).

The certification is bound with 6 college credits from CCAC that can later on be transferred into the Apprenticeship Program.

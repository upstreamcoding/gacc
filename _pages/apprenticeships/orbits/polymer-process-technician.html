        <p class="mb-4">
          A Polymer Process Technician's primary job is to set up, monitor and troubleshoot plastic injection-molding machines. This requires specialized knowledge of materials, specific tools, and equipment. Troubleshooting tasks might include dealing with inconsistent material, faulty equipment, human error, and preventing defects from occurring.
        </p>
        <p>
         Moreover, they ensure injection molding machines, auxiliary equipment and connected automated systems are set to regulation parameters, meet quality standards and all production goals. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, Technicians provide feedback on mold design and assist tool and die makers to dial in each mold for optimal cycle time and quality and are able to apply all aspects of scientific molding. 
        </p>

      <h4 class="mb-3">What will be taught in the classroom section of the program?</h4>
      <p>
        Classroom training will be conducted at CCAC's Mechatronics Lab at their Westhills Center every Friday (apprentices will be paid during classroom training) to give our apprentices a real college experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The curriculum for plastic apprentices includes classes from the Mechatronics occupation i.a. in basic electrical and their components, motor control, wiring, power distribution, hydraulics, pneumatics. On top of that students get additional classes in basic chemistry and plastics and extrusion/injection/blow molding.
      </p>

      What's is the GACC Apprenticeship Model?</h3>
    <p class="text-light mb-3 h4-subtitle">
The dual vocational education and training system allows companies in
Germany to qualify skilled worker exactly as their requirements. Abroad, the
model of dual vocational education and training is often uncommon. This poses
considerable challenges for companies, including German firms, in finding wellqualified skilled workers as needed. Made or planned direct investments of German
companies abroad are at risk. For this reason, The German Chambers of Commerce,
Delegations and Representations of German Industry and Commerce (AHKs),
the German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (IHKs) and the Association of
German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHK e.V.) support companies in
training skilled workers abroad based on the German model.

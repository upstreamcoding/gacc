              We'll never guarantee that one will secure a job from taking an Upstream workshop. We do guarantee that if a member, through their own investment of time and effort, qualifies as a <em>high performer</em>, that companies will have more confidence in their baseline coding competency. It's up to each member to earn the job themselves.

              Hiring a new employee can be an arduous and challenging process. Hiring the wrong employee is a costly mistake. The most reliable and cost-effective way to bring new skills in-house -- and retain great talent -- is to upskill existing employees.
            </p>

            <p>
              Upstream will develop an employee upskilling program specific to a company's tech stack or client service.
            </p>

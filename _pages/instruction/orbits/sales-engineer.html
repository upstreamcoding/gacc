        <p class="mb-4">
          The Sales Engineer Program is one of the four modules of our registered Dual Apprenticeship program. It is a very sophisticated and popular module in Germany as almost every big to middle-sized company trains apprentices in this occupation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our program provides a core understanding of a business organization and the markets it is acting in, with a huge emphasizes on building marketing and sales related skills. On top of the business-related knowledge all apprentices receive fundamental skills in manufacturing processes and production management to give them the technical background they need to pitch a sale or convince buyers with their problem-solving strategy with technical issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this holistic skill set a sales engineer forms a bridge between the customer and the engineering or R&D department of a company as he or she becomes an expert about customer needs and preferences and can determine how products and services could be modified to suit those needs.

        <p class="mb-4">
          CAD / CAM Technical Designers utilize their extensive software knowledge to produce complex projects involving 2D images (surface modeling) and 3D images (solid modeling). They are able to analyze a problem using their mathematical and engineering background and come up with a creative solution. CAD/CAM Technical Designers are working closely with the Engineering team and customers on a variety of projects.

      <hr />

      <h4 class="mb-3">In what areas of a company does a CAD/CAM Technical Designer work?</h4>
      <p>
        During the Apprenticeship Program you will rotate through the different departments of your company beginning from R&D, Engineering and Production side.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is it to get a profound understanding of the product the company produces in order to help become a good designer. The main time of the Apprenticeship Program, the Apprentice will work along with other Designer and Engineers to gain extensive knowledge and skills in CAD/CAM Design software.
      </p>

      <h4 class="mb-3">What does a CAD/CAM Technical Designer do?</h4>
      <p>

      <h4 class="mb-3">In what kind of industries does a CAD/CAM Technical Designer work?</h4>
      <p>
        CAD/CAM Technical Designers are needed in all kind of industries where a highly technical product gets designed and/or manufactured. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We currently have opening at Hennecke Inc. and Veka Inc. They produce and sell various products such as:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Machines that produce polyurethane plastics that are used in a vast variety of products like car seats. Graduates would work as Mechanical Design Engineers.</li>
          <li>Custom vinyl window frames and vinyl decking. Graduates would work as CAD/CAM Designer.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
  
  <h4 class="mb-3">What about the classroom portion of the program?</h4>
      <p>
        Next to working full-time at one of the participating companies the apprentices will have classroom training at CCAC to obtain the Computer-aided Drafting & Design Technology Associate's Degree.
        The curriculum at CCAC includes drafting, engineering, math and technical classes, but also production management and fundamental skills in manufacturing (MT1 certification).
      </p>
      <p>
        Apprentices will be paid while working and getting trained on the job as well as attending their college classes. Moreover, the companies pay the studentâ€™s college tuition, which makes our program an attractive alternative to pay for college education while simultaneously gaining significant work experiences.
      </p>
  
  <h4 class="mb-3">Who can apply to the program?</h4>
      <p>
       Juniors and Seniors in High School can apply for the program. Please your resume to Lisa Conturo lconturo(at)gaccpit.com.
      </p>

      <h4 class="mb-3">What certification do I get upon completion?</h4>
      <p>
        Upon completion the CAD/CAM Technical Design Apprentices receive:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Journeyman papers by the PA Dept. of Labor and Industry (issued by the GACC Pittsburgh Chapter)</li>
          <li>Associates degree from CCAC</li>
          <li>Apprenticeship Certificate from the DIHK</li>
        </ul>
